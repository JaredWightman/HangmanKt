# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Kotlin language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

This project is an in-terminal hangman game where you guess the letters in a phrase. The phrase is constructed with a very simple pattern (Adjective, Noun, Verb, Adjective, Noun) using random words that can be plural or singular.

I wrote this software in order to learn the basics of the Kotlin Language, as well as becoming more familiar with IDE's and Github, since IntelliJ is also new to me.
